Want cute, cuddly plushies of your favorite vanilla mobs? This mod is for you!! This simple lil guy adds a plushy item for you to craft of many vanilla mobs! Use the stuffing (crafted with 9 string) and different colors of wool to craft these cute lil fellas.

JEI is recommended but not required. Crafting recipes are based on the colors of each mob.

Project is NOT abandoned; I work full-time and haven't had the time/energy to continue. As of January 2026, work has resumed :D



Keep in mind that this is just a fun little personal project that I decided to put on Modrinth :) I have very little coding knowledge, and I am learning as I go. And yes, I am well aware that this isn't exactly an original idea, but again, it is just for fun. 

Want to leave feedback? Open an issue on the Github!! I'll respond to comments and try to implement suggestions as often as I can :D
